A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/allanpope/pen/LVWYYd.

 Rebuilding an image using dots. Click anywhere on the canvas to animate the dots into the hidden image, click again to return the dots back to the circle animation.

Built using the getImageData() function to collect pixel colours and positions. 

Not sure who created the original pixel art for the Charizard but found the image on this site: http://fuckyeah-pixels.tumblr.com/post/31290479705
